**ASSISTANT OUTPUT:**

Summary:
This is a 78-year-old male, a retired carpenter, admitted to the hospital after a fall at home resulted in a right intertrochanteric femur fracture. He underwent an Open Reduction Internal Fixation on October 27, 2023, and is now at the skilled nursing facility for further rehabilitation. His relevant past medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and osteoarthritis. He is currently toe-touch weight-bearing on the right lower extremity with standard hip precautions. In the hospital, he progressed to ambulating 50 feet with a rolling walker and minimal assistance. He requires continued therapy to improve strength, balance, and functional mobility with the goal of returning home to his wife in their single-story house.

Detailed Evaluation Responses:
Past Medical History & Hospital Course:
The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, and hyperlipidemia. He was hospitalized on October 26, 2023, after a fall and was diagnosed with a right intertrochanteric femur fracture. He underwent surgical fixation the next day and was medically stable upon discharge to this facility on October 31, 2023. His hospital course was focused on post-operative recovery and initial mobilization with physical and occupational therapy.

Surgeries:
The patient underwent an Open Reduction Internal Fixation of the right hip on October 27, 2023. His past surgical history includes a left Total Knee Arthroplasty in 2018 and a cholecystectomy in 2005.

Respiratory Status:
Not documented.

Diagnostic Imaging Results:
An x-ray of the right hip performed on October 26, 2023, revealed a comminuted intertrochanteric fracture of the right femur with moderate displacement. It also noted the presence of degenerative changes in the hip joint.

Rehab Progression in Hospital:
The patient initiated physical therapy on post-operative day one and progressed from requiring maximal assistance for mobility to minimal assistance upon discharge. He advanced from non-weight bearing to toe-touch weight-bearing on his right leg. His ambulation distance improved from 10 feet with hopping to 50 feet with a rolling walker. Bed mobility improved from maximal to moderate assistance, and transfers improved from maximal to minimal assistance.

Explicit Reason for Referral to PT:
The patient was referred to physical therapy at the skilled nursing facility for continued rehabilitation following his right hip fracture and surgical fixation. The explicit goals are to improve strength, safety, and functional mobility to facilitate a safe return to his prior level of function at home.

Equipment Currently Required:
The patient currently requires a rolling walker for all ambulation and transfers.

Patient’s Posture and Tone:
During his hospital stay, the patient was noted to be positioned supine in bed with his right lower extremity elevated. Further details on current posture and muscle tone are not documented.

Informal Assessment and Clinical Impressions:
Initial assessment in the hospital revealed significant right lower extremity weakness, with hip abduction strength of 1/5 and knee extension of 2/5. His left lower extremity and upper extremities were stronger at 4/5. His balance was poor during initial gait attempts. Pain was a limiting factor, initially rated at 7/10.
The clinical impression is of a patient with significant deconditioning and functional deficits secondary to his fracture and surgery. His primary impairments are decreased strength in the operative leg, impaired balance, and dependence on a mobility aid with supervision. His motivation appears good, and he has potential to return to his prior functional level with intensive therapy.

Short-Term and Long-Term Goals:
Short-term goals over 6 weeks include achieving ambulation of 150 feet with a rolling walker on level surfaces with modified independence and ascending/descending a curb with contact guard assist. Baseline is ambulation of 50 feet with minimal assistance and inability to manage curbs. Another goal is to perform transfers from all surfaces with setup assistance only. Baseline is minimal assistance for transfers. Long-term goals over 12 weeks include returning to community ambulation with a single-point cane for over 500 feet and ascending/descending a flight of stairs. Baseline is non-stair-climbing ability and use of a rolling walker.

Glanceable List of All PT Precautions:
Toe-touch weight-bearing right lower extremity for 6 weeks, no right hip flexion beyond 90 degrees, no right hip adduction past midline, no right hip internal rotation.

Social History / Living Situation:
The patient is a retired carpenter who lives with his wife in a single-story home. The home has one step to enter. Prior to his fall, he was independent with all mobility and activities of daily living, using a single-point cane only for walking in the community.

ROM Limitations or Sensory Impairments:
In the hospital, right hip flexion was limited to 70 degrees due to pain and post-surgical precautions. Range of motion for all other extremities was documented as within functional limits. Sensory impairments are not documented.

Physical Milestones Achieved to Date:
The patient has achieved the ability to transfer from bed to a chair with minimal assistance and can ambulate 50 feet with a rolling walker while maintaining toe-touch weight-bearing precautions.

Gross Motor Coordination / Control:
The patient required minimal assistance for sequencing and balance during ambulation in the hospital, indicating some deficits in gross motor coordination and control following his injury and surgery.

Observable Presentation on First Meeting:
Not documented, as the initial meeting at this facility has not yet occurred. The hospital notes describe him as alert, oriented, and cooperative.

PT-Specific Implications and Critical Insights:
The patient is on Eliquis for DVT prophylaxis, which increases the risk of bleeding; caution is advised to prevent falls or injury. His pain level should be monitored closely to ensure adequate participation in therapy, coordinating with nursing for pre-medication if needed. The patient's history of osteoarthritis and a prior left total knee arthroplasty may affect his compensatory strategies and overall mobility. The combination of hip precautions and weight-bearing restrictions requires careful and consistent patient education and cueing to prevent surgical complications. His motivation is a positive prognostic indicator.

Recommendations:
Initiate a comprehensive physical therapy program 5 times per week. Focus on therapeutic exercises for right hip and core strengthening, beginning with isometric and active-assisted range of motion exercises within precaution limits. Progress strengthening as tolerated. Gait training should focus on proper sequencing and adherence to weight-bearing status with the rolling walker. Balance training, including static and dynamic activities, is critical to reduce fall risk. Patient and family education on hip precautions, weight-bearing status, and home safety is essential. Assess the need for a home evaluation prior to discharge.
